You will write two programs: perceplearn.py will learn perceptron models (vanilla and averaged) from the training data, 
and percepclassify.py will use the models to classify new data.
The learning program will be invoked in the following way:

> python perceplearn.py /path/to/input

The argument is a single file containing the training data; the program will learn perceptron models, and write the model 
parameters to two files: vanillamodel.txt for the vanilla perceptron, and averagedmodel.txt for the averaged perceptron. 

The classification program will be invoked in the following way:

> python percepclassify.py /path/to/model /path/to/input

The first argument is the path to the model file (vanillamodel.txt or averagedmodel.txt), and the second argument is the 
path to a file containing the test data file; the program will read the parameters of a perceptron model from the model file, 
classify each entry in the test data, and write the results to a text file called percepoutput.txt in the same format as the answer key.
